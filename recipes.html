    <h3>Kvass</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1000ml water</li>
        <li>47g toasted rye bread</li>
        <li>85g sugar</li>
        <li>1/5th tbsp dried instant yeast</li>
        <li>10 raisins</li>
    </ul>
    Bring water to boil. Remove from heat. Put in the bread and the raisins. Cover with lid and leave overnight to cool to room temperature.
    Remove bread and raisins, and then filter (e.g. through a coffee filter). Add sugar and dissolve. Add yeast.
    Cover and leave for around 6 hours, or overnight. Bottle, and leave the bottles at room temperature overnight to build carbonation.
    Then refridgerate.
    
    <h3>Kombucha</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2000ml water</li>
        <li>6 black/green teabags</li>
        <li>170g sugar</li>
        <li>100ml starter</li>
        <li>SCOBY</li>
    </ul>
    In a pan, boil 500ml of the water. When boiled, add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the teabags.
    After 10 minutes, remove the teabags and then add the remaining 1500ml of water to the pan.
    Leave until cooled to room temperature.
    Then transfer the liquid to a jar, add in the starter and then the SCOBY.
    Cover with a cloth/kitchen towl and secure it with a rubber band or similar.
    Leave to brew at room temperature until desired taste, testing it after a week. 
    When done, strain and put in to bottles.
    If you want carbonation, add half a teaspoon of sugar to each bottle and leave at room temperature for a few days to undergo second fermentation, and then refridgerate.
    Otherwise, refridgerate immediately.
