- Thought about how to prove that every chordal strip
has a 'left-to-right' ordering w.r.t. rungs.

- Assuming that I have such a lemma (above), I continued
working on the 'main part' of the proof that my ordering
is a Tucker ordering.

- Meeting with Sam and Peter about marking advanced software
engineering.

- Continued proving cases.

- Extracted one or two arguments out into claims.

- Found out that we need a kind of symmetric thing of $W_{i+1}^*$.
I defined $V_i^*$ and it seems we need to prove that
$G[ V_i^* \cup \mathcal{S}_{i,i+1} \cup W_{i+1}^* ]$ is a strip.

- Had a meeting with Kristina to discuss the left-right
interval ordering of rungs in chordal strips thing.
We thought we knew how to prove it simply, but I tried
writing it up after the call and it is much more complicated.

- The path order lemma was incorrecet so I changed the statement
of the lemma and updated the proof.

- Worked on figuring out what happens with $V_i$ and $W_i$,
how they can intersect etc.
