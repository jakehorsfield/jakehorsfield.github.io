- thought about how to prove that every chordal strip
has a 'left-to-right' ordering w.r.t. rungs.

- assuming that I have such a lemma (above), I continued
working on the 'main part' of the proof that my ordering
is a Tucker ordering.

- meeting with Sam and Peter about marking advanced software
engineering
