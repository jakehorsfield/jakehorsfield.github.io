        Lately I am trying to ditch websites/apps that are primarily
        built to keep the user on the website/app for as long as possible.
        YouTube does this by having endless recommendations for videos
        similar to the one that you have just watched. Unless you turn
        the feature off, I believe YouTube even plays these recommended
        videos for you automatically!
        </p>

        <p>
        Here I give instructions for setting up newsboat (an RSS feed reader)
        and mpv (a video player) so that you can watch videos from select
        YouTube channels without ever having to open the YouTube website
        (or even a website).
